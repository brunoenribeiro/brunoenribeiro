### Greetings from Brazil! ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I have over 6 years of experience in front-end development, and over 15 years in the web industry.

Experienced with industry-standard technologies such as React, Next.js, Angular, Vue, Cypress.io, GitHub Actions, AWS, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript, leveraging AI's power with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

I have led front-end teams for several companies, leaving a legacy of polished codebases, efficient CI/CD pipelines, extensive automated tests, capable teams, and a culture of teamwork and excellence.

Looking for dynamic, challenging, and productive environments!
